Code to statistically analyse a data set
Data set to be analysed is Fisher's Iris Data Set
The Iris dataset was published and discussed in RObert Fishers 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problem". The data was collected to quantify the physical variation of Iris flowers of three related species. 
The data set consists of 50 samples from three species of iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor). 
The four features measured were the length and width of the sepals and petals in centimetres. 
The combination of these four features can be used to identify each particular species

    *Have created code to import the numpy program for performing scientific calculations
    *Have used iPython on CMDER to check that code i am writing is error free. i have found some errors but have resolved them. see notes in code for examples
    *Have written code to find the mean value for data in each column
    *Prepared a HIPO project plan which is a hierarchy Input Process Output flow chart showing how i will creat small simple modules for codes then joining together into a larger module.

    *Updated initial code and broke into smaller, simple modules to perform each data analysis - mean, standard deviation, min/max values and graphs - s per HIPO project plan
    *Combined smaller modules into one larger module for basic statisitics. If i have time I would like to look at having the output be in a table.
    *Began some initial graphs - scatterplot successful, histograms next
    *Next step is to sub divide it by species and create graphs.
    *Need to look at how to report output in 1 or 2 decimal places

25April2019
    *Worked on labelling the scatter graph title and axes. Used and reread https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html using a practise file to copy and paste code from tutorial so i could understand what each line of code would do. 
    *I was also able to create histograms. 
    *Currently output in "BasicGraphs.py" shows scatter plots (four graphs - two proahs per two window) and histograms (four graphs pn one window and one graph on four windows)  
    *Next steps to look at dividing output by species
