Code to statistically analyse a data set
Data set to be analysed is Fisher's Iris Data Set
The Iris dataset was published and discussed in RObert Fishers 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problem". The data was collected to quantify the physical variation of Iris flowers of three related species. 
The data set consists of 50 samples from three species of iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor). 
The four features measured were the length and width of the sepals and petals in centimetres. 
The combination of these four features can be used to identify each particular species

    Have created code to import the numpy program for performing scientific calculations
    Have used iPython on CMDER to check that code i am writing is error free. i have found some errors but have resolved them. see notes in code for examples
    Have written code to find the mean value for data in each column. Next step is to sub divide it by species and create graphs.
